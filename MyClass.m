In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises when dealing with memory management and ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider this scenario: You have a class 'MyClass' that retains a strong reference to another object 'AnotherClass'.  If 'MyClass' is deallocated, but 'AnotherClass' still has a strong reference to something else that holds a reference to 'MyClass', a retain cycle is created.  This prevents 'AnotherClass' from being deallocated and results in a memory leak.  The problem is subtle because it doesn't immediately crash the app; it silently consumes memory over time.
